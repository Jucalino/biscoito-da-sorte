          Do you know the fortune cookie story? Legend has it that it appeared
          in China at the time of the wars for the unification of the territory.
          It is said that the Mongols did not like these biscuits, so the troops
          took advantage that they did not eat and put secret messages inside
          the biscuit for men on the battlefield. In this way, the Chinese won
          the war and unified part of the territory that today is China itself.
